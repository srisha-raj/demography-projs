# 📊 Demography Projects – Exploratory Analyses by Srisha Raj

Welcome! This repository contains exploratory data projects related to demography — particularly focusing on fertility, population policy, and social change. These analyses are intended to help me practice **causal inference techniques**, **data cleaning**, and **visualization**.

## 👩‍💻 About Me

I'm a third-year Statistics student at UC Berkeley, passionate about using social research to inform policy design. I have a growing interest in **family, gender, and life-course demography**, which will be the focus of many of the projects here.

My background is in **statistical methods and applied research**, and I’m developing skills in libraries such as `pandas`, `statsmodels`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`, with a focus on causal inference methods like **Difference-in-Differences (DiD)**.

This space is exploratory — a place for me to experiment, stay curious, and build toward more structured, publishable work. My goal is to **document my process transparently** and learn through doing!

Eventually, I hope to work at a research institution, such as a university-affiliated lab, a policy think tank, or a data journalism outlet specializing in family policy or demographic research 💙
